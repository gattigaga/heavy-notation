## About

Heavy Notation is a simplified web-based note-taking application inspired by Notion.

The application provides users with the following features:

- User authentication
- Page creation and deletion
- Page title editing
- Page search
- Block creation and deletion
- Block content editing
- Block reordering within a page

The project is deployed on Vercel.

## Motivation

Heavy Notation is more than just a note-taking appâ€”it's my playground for exploring modern web technologies and pushing my frontend development skills.

Inspired by tools like Notion, I wanted to create an application that demonstrates:
- Complex state management
- Seamless user interactions
- Modern React ecosystem best practices
- Responsive web design

This project represents my commitment to building intuitive, performant web applications.
